SNSC 2.3 Part Reversengineering for Personal Use.


This project aims to revers engineer the beloved SNSC 2.3 also known as Ninebot Max Plus.
Here are some information for the SNSC 2.3, the SNSC is a slight modification of the segway version of the Ninebot Max Plus as a rental. 

Certain countries, are copying the VOI Design of the rental, a lot of parts are from the company Segway, within the branding "Ninebot" as for an example, the turn lights, the end knobs on the handle bar, the fork suspension and even the dual break system. There is a lot more to count in into the list but this will be updated in the future.


the current state is, that I am working on the end knobs and the reflector shielding. If you wish to contribute, do not hestitate and use the issue tab.
